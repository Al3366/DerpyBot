# TODO
Things I'd like (or need) to do

## Short-term
- I think the point system is not working/saving properly, gotta look into that
- fix trigger so people don't accidentally delete a trigger (either add separate commands for updating/deleting, or !trigger args like !trigger add/del/up)
- Reset all point types at the 1st of the month
- skip bad soundcloud links
- skip songs longer than XX minutes with the ability to cancel it
- make dope, dig, nice, ill, sick also increment props
- add !flattr & !tip @[username] capabilities, need accesss to PMs from dubapi first
- track short-term song history and make sure song hasn't been played within X amount of time
- setup continuous integration.  If Travis doesn't fail, auto-merge into master, then use cron to auto-update on server
- move commands into a gh-pages accessible file

## Long-term
- switch to TypeScript, instead of ES6/Babel cause I'd like to catch some errors on compile
- finish going through the rest of the forked code I haven't touched and clean some things up
- create a website for derpybot,  maybe its own github, move commands info there
- ADD TESTS.. mocha, chai, supertest, etc
